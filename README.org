#+TITLE: An Example of Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion

This repository contains an example of srceen space ambient occlusion using
OpenGL 4.5 (and in particular, direct state access). The technique is almost
exactly taken from [[http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/ssao-tutorial.html][John Chapman's superb explanation]]. The code is not
particularly clean Haskell, but I wanted to avoid any tracks for sake of example
clarity.
